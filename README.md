# 🍅 Tomato Disease Detector

Detect common tomato leaf diseases using a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow + MobileNetV2**.

This tool helps farmers, students, and researchers identify tomato plant health conditions from leaf images.

## 🌿 How to Use

1. Upload a photo of a **tomato leaf** (JPG/PNG format).
2. Wait a few seconds while the model analyzes the image.
3. The app will display:
   - The **predicted disease** (or “Healthy”),
   - **Confidence level**, and
   - **Prevention tips**.
